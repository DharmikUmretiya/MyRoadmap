# ðŸŽ¯ 3-Year Tech Roadmap â€“ Interactive React App

This is a **personal interactive roadmap app** that visualizes my journey over four years of learning and development. Itâ€™s a modular, responsive, one-page app built using **React + Vite**, designed to help me stay focused and track my progress.

## ðŸ§  Learning Notes

> ðŸ”° This project does **not follow best practices fully**.  
> But thatâ€™s intentional â€” I built it while learning and improving my understanding of:
- Components and props
- State management with `useState`
- Scrollable UI and `useRef`
- File structure and modular design
- React rendering flow
